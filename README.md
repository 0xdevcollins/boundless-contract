# Boundless Project

## Overview
Boundless is a Soroban-based smart contract project that leverages the Stellar blockchain network. This project implements smart contracts using the Soroban SDK, providing a secure and efficient way to build decentralized applications.

## Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Soroban CLI
- Stellar development environment

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/boundless.git
   cd boundless
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cd boundless
   cargo build
   ```

### Development
- New contracts should be added to the `contracts` directory
- Each contract should have its own directory with a `Cargo.toml` file
- Contracts inherit dependencies from the workspace-level `Cargo.toml`

## Smart Contracts
The project uses Soroban SDK version 22.0.0 for smart contract development. Each contract in the `contracts` directory is a separate Rust crate that can be built and deployed independently.

### Building Contracts
```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

### Testing
```bash
cargo test
```

## Configuration
The project uses the following optimization settings for release builds:
- Maximum optimization level
- Overflow checks enabled
- Debug symbols stripped
- Link-time optimization enabled
- Single codegen unit for better optimization
